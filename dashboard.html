        Hotel cali : On a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas Rising up through the air up air Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew grew dim I had to stop for the night
Adding changes

        There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell bell And I was thinkin' to myself "This could be heaven or this could be hell"
Then she lit up a candle And she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say
